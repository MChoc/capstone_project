Week 8: 
-Continued to work on menu feature for managers

-I think I have a workaround for the bug, however this has it's own problems
have asked everyone in the group for possible solutions, nothing seems to be working
will continue to search for a solution

Week 9: 
-haven't managed to get past bug with Angualar however I've managed to sidestep it,
however this means that merging and pulling for git will now take quite a bit longer and 
certain files in my workspace will not be compatible with the git files. I don't expect this issue
of compatibility to be a great problem
